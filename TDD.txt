TDD with Ruby

Test driven development

First thing to do is to write a test, then it should fail.
(Write a failing test)

Second thing, make the test go green with the smallest amount of code possible.

Third thind, refactor, as long as we have a green test, we know we havent broken anything
so we can be a bit braver with our refactoring decisions

Ussualy used for Unit Tests (Individual units of code)

	Defining the Interface first (mini blackbox test for the class)


---------
RSpec

Tool for doing TDD

Make sure you have the RSpec gem

Rspec will look for a folder called Spec and expect to find the tests in there
Every project will have its own Spec folder

Will only identify tests which look like person_spec.rb

When in the project folder write rspec.
