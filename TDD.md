##Test Driven Development (TDD)

1) *First thing* to do when writing a test, **is to make sure it fails.**

2) *Second thing,* make the test go **green** with the **smallest amount of code possible.**

3) *Third thing,* **refactoring,** as long as we have a green test, we know we haven't broken anything
so we can be a bit braver with our refactoring decisions

Usually, used for **Unit Tests**. It's where you define the Interface first, so a miniature form of black box.

##RSpec

It's a Tool for doing **TDD**.

Make sure you have the RSpec gem installed. RSpec will look for a folder called spec and expect to find the tests in there so ensure that you create a new spec folder for a project.

Will only identify tests when in the format:

		person_spec.rb

When in the project folder write Rspec and write some specs up.
