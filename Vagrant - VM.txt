Practical Vim, Drew Neil

Vim is available everywhere where you have a shell
Available on remote and cloud machines
Available on local VMs, Docker containers (like VM but smaller) etc
It's extremely powerful
it encourages DRY (Dont Repeat Yourself) in your editing/navigation 

To get the most out of it . . .
Learn how to use bash
Configure it right
Practice, practice, practice
Learn to touch type, www.typingclub.com
Accept you won't know it all

Vim is different from everything else you've used
Dont use it work, start by using in the evenings and weekends
Dont use your mouse. Ever
There's always a better way, you just havent learned it yet
Try to learn something new every week
